# Movie Recommendation System

Made Movie Recommendation System using Python & Django with Bloom Filter for course project 'CS201: Data Structures II' at Habib University.

## Overview

## Setup

The first thing to do is to clone the repository:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/hammadmaqdoom/Movie-Recommendation-System.git
$ cd movieRsystem
```

Create a virtual environment to install dependencies in and activate it:

```sh
$ venv venv
$ .\.venv\Scripts\Activate
```

Then install the dependencies:

```sh
(venv)$ py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Note the `(env)` in front of the prompt. This indicates that this terminal
session operates in a virtual environment set up by `virtualenv`.

Once `pip` has finished downloading the dependencies:
```sh
(env)$ cd movieRsystem
(env)$ python manage.py runserver
```
And navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.
